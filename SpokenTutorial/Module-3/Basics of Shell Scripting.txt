1) Write a simple Bash program to get the following system variables:
   a. pwd
   b. logname

Ans:
cd=$(pwd)
echo "$cd"

login=$(logname)
echo "$login"


2) Write a simple Bash program:
   a. To ask username from user
   b. Exit the program, if user does not enter anything within 10 seconds
   
   Hint: read -t 10 -p

Ans:
echo "Enter a username:"
read -t 10 username


if [ -z "$username" ]; then
    echo "Exiting"
    exit 1
fi

echo "Hi, $username!"
