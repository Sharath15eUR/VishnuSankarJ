Conditional execution

1) Write a script which will take your name as an input.
2) It should check this name with your system's username.
3) If the username matches, it should greet you by displaying "Hello".
4) Else, it should display "Try again"

HINT: Your system's username is stored in a variable $USER 

Ans:
echo "Please enter your name:"
read input_name

system_username=$USER

if [ "$input_name" == "$system_username" ]; then
    echo "Hello, $input_name!"
else
    echo "Try again."
fi
